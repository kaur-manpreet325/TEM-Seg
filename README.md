# Deep Learning-Optimized Nanoparticle Segmentation and Tracking in HR-TEM
## Introduction
High-Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy (HR-TEM) is a crucial technique in materials science, enabling the visualization of atomic structures with sub-nanometer resolution. However, accurate segmentation and tracking of nanoparticles in HR-TEM images remain challenging due to factors such as noise, contrast variations, and dynamic morphological changes.

This project aims to develop a **semi-automated annotation pipeline** and a **deep learning-based segmentation and tracking framework** to enhance the accuracy and consistency of nanoparticle analysis in TEM images. We integrate **YOLO and Segment Anything Model (SAM) for segmentation** and **Decoupled Association and Online Training (DeAOT) for tracking**, ensuring robust performance even in complex experimental conditions. Our methodology is benchmarked against existing techniques using key evaluation metrics such as Intersection over Union (IoU), Dice Coefficient, Multi-Object Tracking Accuracy (MOTA), and Multi-Object Tracking Precision (MOTP).

This repository contains the source code, datasets, and implementation details for our proposed framework, along with benchmarking results and evaluation metrics.
